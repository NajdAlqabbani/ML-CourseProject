# ML-CourseProject
 ### Estimation of obesity levels using Machine Learning models (Random Forest) : 
 As one of the supervised machine learning algorithms that is frequently used in 
classification and regression, we have selected the Random Forest classification model 
for our project. It is integrated into multiple decision trees as opposed to just one, and 
the decision tree with the most votes is chosen based on each tree's projected outcome. 
One of a random forest's key characteristics is its ability to handle data sets with both 
continuous and categorical variables for classification and regression. Because of its 
implementation flexibility and our prior experience, we chose Random Forest.


### Goal State :
Our aim is to classify the Level of Obesity of individuals based on estimation features 
given. in addition, there is an "insufficient weight", which indicates that the model 
does not have information to determine the obesity level. 
Our main goal is to build a ML model, train it and make it estimate the Level of Obesity of 
individuals, by Random Forest model.
